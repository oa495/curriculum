# Code Cooperative Curriculum

## Description

The Code Cooperative curriculum is **a guide** that supports our mentors and students in their learning goals & development of their project. 

Each student has different learning goals and each project is different so this curriculum is a resource that doesnâ€™t aim to cover everything but rather serves as a jumping off point and something for our members to come back to when they need help.
